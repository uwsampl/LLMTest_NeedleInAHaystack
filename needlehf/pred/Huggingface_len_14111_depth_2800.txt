The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.

September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.
I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
most honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.

But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.

Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most
philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language.
I'm not sure how much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people
realized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather
than becoming philosophy professors.

How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent
thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are
interesting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting
questions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to
approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get
lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down
like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong.
