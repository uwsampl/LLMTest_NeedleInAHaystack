One of the\nless honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job\ntraining where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively\nimpractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes\nor putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms\nof impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying\nphilosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people\nmajoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain\nknowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you\nwouldn't find those in our high school library.  But I tried to\nread Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,\nbut they sounded like they were talking about something important.\nI assumed I'd learn what in college.The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned\na lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy\n101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was\nmy fault I hadn't learned anything.  I hadn't read the books we\nwere assigned carefully enough.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles\nof Human Knowledge another shot in college.  Anything so admired\nand so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could\nonly figure out what.Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  I have\na nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems\nunlikely.The difference between then and now is that now I understand why\nBerkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I see\nnow what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It\ndidn't work out as I'd hoped.  I didn't learn any magical truths\ncompared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But\nI do at least know now why I didn't.  Philosophy doesn't really\nhave a subject matter in the way math or history or most other\nuniversity subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must\nmaster.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various\nindividual philosophers have said about different topics over the\nyears.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten\nwho discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in\nlogic.  I don't know if I learned anything from them.\n[1]\nIt does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in\none's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of\npossibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a\ncouple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance\nof thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.
